## About

### Description and Purpose

The purpose of this application is to foster meaningful connections among logged-in users from around the world, whether youâ€™re seeking friendship or romance. This platform offers an open and free communication network, allowing users to browse through profiles of others. Users can send a suggested location or meeting place to someone they are interested in, and the recipient can choose to accept or decline the invitation. Once an invitation is accepted, a communication channel opens, giving both users a finite amount of time to meet and connect in person. This application aims to encourage users to transition from online interactions to real-life experiences, exploring and engaging with others in various locations and places.

### Inspiration

The inspiration for this application is applications that are related to dating apps and event/friendship connection applications. From my experience most people do not take any of these apps seriously and most often than not these apps are left dormant with conversations never lasting that long. What we hope to do is advance conversations created online between newly found friendships and love interests to more interactive real life scenarios that build lasting memories for both parties. This also removes the need for empty conversations that go nowhere since now they automatically text or video chat with the person they interest in and have a location in real life to meet up.

### User Profile Creation

Users will be given the ability to create a profile and login with said created profile. The data a user can add and store includes 3 to 5 pictures of the user, what interests they have, physical attributes, hobbies and much more.

### Search Other Users/Locations

Users will be able to search other users on the web application through either the use of swiping (left for interested or right for interested). Right swiped users will be added to the list of users you can search through. Also you can add locations or view locations users have visited. And from there you can see user reviews of that location, how it went and tag other users that you went with

### Send Location -> Accept/Reject -> Communication Channel Opened

Once two users are interested both users can send exactly one location that they would like to meet and interact at. This can be from our database of locations or a location not yet added. From there if the other user accepts the location a communication channel is initiated and both users can start communicating and setting up a date to meet up.
