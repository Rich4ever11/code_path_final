## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

This unit allowed the folder structure to be created and created a great launchpad for adding new features.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

Errors during coding and fixing small bugs that could truly effect a users experience.

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

All tasking have been finished and great work has been completed for the week

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

I say the chat communication is at risk. I think communication can be implemented easily however the location aspect can get complex if we develope to many mini features and get too hyperfocused.

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

We will need aditional time outside of class to complete all features and possibly information related to user login and profile management.
