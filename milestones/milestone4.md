## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

Developing the front end went well and having it interface with the backend.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

We ran into a difficult error when trying to use just postgres SQL, Vite and the crypto library for handling authentication so we made a switch to using firebase as it worked easily for handling user sessions and authenticating users.

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

We finished most of the tasking for this week. We had external conflits to deal with that took me away from coding (Weddings and Exams). We plan to work harder during the last stretch to make sure all features are implemented to the best of there ability.

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

Right now the chat feature is the most at risk. We will make them more of a priority in this coming week so that at least the bare minum features are added.

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

We will need support in the form of deploying the application once it is finished and setting aside more time to code.
